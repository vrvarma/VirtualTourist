# VirtualTourist
Udacity VirtualTourist Project 4

VirtualTourist is an app that allows the user to download and store images from Flickr.  It will allow the users to drop pins on a map.  The user will then be able to download the pictures for the location and persist both the pictures and the association of the pin.

*  On dropping the pin, the app prefetches the images
*  The app allows the user to drag the pin to a new location.
